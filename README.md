## Development notes

- Added `projects/` case study templates for `eye-tracking` and `chess-clock` (markdown). Fill them with images, build steps and results.
- Added `js/github-repos.js`: client-side script that fetches and renders top-3 public repositories into `#repos-list` on the homepage. Uses anonymous GitHub API (rate-limited).

To preview locally, serve the folder with a static fileserver (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`) and open `http://localhost:8000`.
